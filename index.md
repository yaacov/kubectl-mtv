# kubectl-mtv Technical Guide

Welcome to the technical guide for `kubectl-mtv` - the powerful command-line interface that transforms how you migrate virtual machines to Kubernetes.

`kubectl-mtv` is a sophisticated CLI plugin that enables seamless migration of virtual machines from traditional virtualization platforms (VMware vSphere, Red Hat Virtualization, OpenStack, and more) directly to KubeVirt-enabled Kubernetes clusters. Built on top of the proven Forklift migration engine, it provides advanced features like:

- **SQL-like query capabilities** for VM discovery and filtering
- **Intelligent resource mapping** between source and target environments  
- **AI-powered assistance** through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration
- **Advanced migration strategies** (cold, warm, live, conversion migrations)
- **Enterprise storage integration** with array offloading capabilities

Whether you're migrating a single development VM or orchestrating enterprise-scale datacenter transformations, this guide provides everything you need to master kubectl-mtv.
